The EU is the most successful peace project in human history and has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Europeans are closely linked economically and culturally, and through the democratic values we share.\nSingle Market The single market is the world's most highly developed and open marketplace. It is based on the EU‚Äôs 4 key freedoms, which enable you and other citizens to:\n live or work in any EU country move your money sell goods without restrictions provide services on the same basis  High food \u0026amp; environmental standards Because EU countries cooperate so closely, our food and our environment meet some of the world's highest quality standards. Unscrupulous companies can't get away with selling contaminated food or polluting our rivers and countryside.\nConsumer benefits Shoppers can now feel safe in the knowledge that they will get their money back if they return products. Travellers can buy train or plane tickets, knowing they can get a refund if their journey is delayed or cancelled. And the standards which goods in EU shops are required to meet are among the world's most stringent, in terms of both quality and safety.\nHuman Rights The EU protects all minorities and vulnerable groups, and stands up for the oppressed. Regardless of a person's nationality, gender, language group, culture, profession, disability or sexuality, the EU insists on equal treatment for all.\nGlobal Power EU countries acting in unison have much more of a voice on the world stage than 28 small and medium-sized nations acting separately. We have political clout. As regards trade, our regulatory and product standards are adopted worldwide as the global norm.\n This text is an extract from the EU's own web site on the subject \u0026hellip;\n(https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/what-the-eu-does-for-its-citizens_en)\n","href":"/posts/eu-citizen-benefits/","title":"EU Citizen Benefits"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/global-power/","title":"Global Power"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/human-rights/","title":"Human Rights"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/peace/","title":"Peace"},{"content":"Here is a rather cheerful way of showing the EU flag and encompassing all the benefits of membership\n","href":"/posts/eu-flag-annotated/","title":"Annotated EU Flag"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/benefits/","title":"Benefits"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/eu-flag/","title":"EU Flag"},{"content":"Here is a good list of reasons to be Pro EU \u0026hellip;\nI am not Pro EU as default.\nI\u0026#39;m...\nPro Peace\nPro Cooperation\nPro Good Friday Agreement\nPro Immigration\nPro Science\nPro Security\nPro Education\nPro Business\nPro Trade\nPro Human Rights\nPro Workers Rights\nPro NHS\nPro Multi-Cultural\nAll these thing mean I am automatically Pro EU.\n\u0026mdash; üî∂Ô∏èChantelle Seddon (@ChantelleSeddon) January 10, 2020  ","href":"/posts/reasons-pro-eu/","title":"Reasons to be pro EU"},{"content":"","href":"/referendum/","title":"2016 Referendum"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/eu-court/","title":"EU Court"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/eu-law/","title":"EU Law"},{"content":"Lots of rubbish in the campaign about the EU imposing rules on us and not a lot about the fact that we agreed with nearly all of them and for those few we opposed we were always on the wrong side of the argument.\nFortunately, someone has done the hard work and anaylsed all of the individual laws and provided a neat summary on Twitter.\n EU laws A breakdown of all the EU laws that we have adopted and a list of those we opposed \u0026hellip;\nThe commons library looked at how many UK laws were influenced by EU laws. https://t.co/jTb6CQU2mx\n4,514 out of 34,105.\nAnd out of the EU laws that influenced the 4,514 ....Vote Leave discovered 72 that were forced on us against our will. 72! https://t.co/EqZXZBruBM\n... pic.twitter.com/gdNWUcTgRd\n\u0026mdash; Jim Grace #FBPE (@mac_puck) January 21, 2019   EU Court judgements Followed by a list of all the EU Court judgements against the UK government \u0026hellip;\nI went through all 72 Directives that HMG opposed but still got passedhttps://t.co/nC3NuO19d3\nand the 89 CJEU judgements against HMGhttps://t.co/lHrf2vdl9K\nTLDR: I discovered that WE were the bad guys in EVERY SINGLE case. pic.twitter.com/Qeu8TCyie1\n\u0026mdash; Jim Grace #FBPE (@mac_puck) March 13, 2019  ","href":"/referendum/eu-rules-imposed/","title":"EU rules imposed on UK"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"}]
